# website-DeepBenBello.ai
Repository to collect code and material for [deepbenbello.ai](deepbenbello.ai) website.

## Introduction
Any organisation has its own website. This is ours and also our first project.
This repository collects the code for it and the readme aim is to describe it.

But before we get right into it, let’s introduce ourselves — We are a team of four good friends with different coding backgrounds, ranging from very limited to advanced coding experience.
We all come from Physics studies (different specialisations, though), and we work in different areas.
By creating __DeepBenBello__, we made a little dream come true. We wanted to have something to work on together, to start engaging with tech applications and to create something beautiful.

Back to the website, the goal was to design and develop a modern website, with great emphasis on details and design. We tried to include animations, user interaction and modern technologies. All of these to give a deep and pleasing user experience.
